# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms

The simulation of following process scheduling algorithms : FCFS, SJF, RoundRobin.

The simulation is based on creating random sequence of processes of random length and checking the average waiting time for using each of three basic alogrithms. It is very useful to understand all advantages and disadvantages of process scheduling algorithms and to compare them. The project also consists "Menu" in the file lab1.java, which can be useful for the user.

RoundRobin algorithm is more complicated than the other two, so the implementation differs a bit.
